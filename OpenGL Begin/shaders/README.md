# Shaders

## Vector Types

vecn: the default vector of n floats.

bvecn: a vector of n booleans.

ivecn: a vector of n integers.

uvecn: a vector of n unsigned integers.

dvecn: a vector of n double components.

## ins, outs and uniforms

work as binding joints in between shaders and programs.

uniform acts as a global reference and stays constant till redefined.

Can be used to change color dynamically during runtime
## Attributes

More than one attribute can be added for various use, we can define vertex-wise color by inserting color vectors in the vertex array and then use a new attribute to define how it is used. Hence assign a different color to each vertex.

## Shader Class

preprocessor directives (Helps compile the header file once and once only)
